# Flashcard using C language
We all have, at some point in our lives, have studied through flashcards, but in this era of technology-where everything is behind the screens of our laptops, I thought of writting down a code in C programming language that allows the user to make anD review flashcards digitally! 
## Why C language ?
I'm a beginner in the feild of computer science. The only language that I have knowledge about is C! This project can be taken to another level using web dev and i look forward to upgrade this as soon as I learn more! This project is just an implementation of the knowledge I've gained so far.
## How does the project work?
1.) The user is asked to input 1, 2, or zero in order to add, review the flashcard or exit the code respectively.

2.) A basic switch case ladder is used to perform the different operations.

3.) A structure is defined which has 2 string elements, question and answer.

4.) If flashcards are to be added, the user is asked to enter the name of the subject. The file of that name is created. 

5.) The user is now asked to input the number of questions or as we can say-the number of flashcards to be made.

6.) An array of the structure is defined to which the user inputs the questions and answers which is then passed to the file using the basic file handeling operations.

7.) That is how a user can add as many flashcards as he wants. To review them, input 2, and the data is read from the file of the subject that the user inputs the name for.

8.) The question is printed and the answer is kept hidden until the user presses enter key. The answer when displayed, user is asked if he/she got it right or not. That id how the project also displayes the number of questions answered correctly.

## How to use this project?
1.) Download the flashcard.exe file and run it. The error might pop up, to overcome that, click on 'more info' at the end of the pop up shown, and click 'run anyway'.
