# Flashcard using C language
We all have, at some point in our lives, have studied through flashcards, but in this era of technology-where everything is behind the screens of our laptops, I thought of writting down a code in C programming language that allows the user to make anD review flashcards digitally! 
## why C language ?
I'm a beginner in the feild of computer science. The only language that I have knowledge about is C! This project can be taken to another level using web dev and i look forward to upgrade this as soon as I learn more! This project is just an implementation of the knowledge I've gained so far.
